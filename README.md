Basic utilities:

0. Note: The present simulation evolves the system using one phase map only. 
    It is yet to account for the other part (forcing in the opposite tilt direction).
    Though it is sufficient (?) since most theoretical work focus on repeatedly iterating through one map.

1. Simulate the trajectories of an ensemble of objects using toy model (cubic maps)
    - The user specifies:
      a. Three points in the form x-coord (space) y-coord, press "enter" after each point, insert extra line after all three points specified
      b. Number of objects in the ensemble
      c. Number of iterations to evolve the dynamical system
      d. Numer of time-sequences to average over.
